<h2>Ingredients-What You Need to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>
<p>
  If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already have
  everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Flour All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes
    structure and pleasant chewiness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sugar Granulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and may
    create a tender texture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Baking Powder Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the
    batter, which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Salt Salt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including
    pancakes. You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but you'll
    miss it if you leave it out.
  </li>
  <li>
    An Egg Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure.
    The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.
  </li>
  <li>
    Milk Not only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential
    for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vegetable Oil Vegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great
    fat to use in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them
    from sticking to the pan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bananas Last but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for
    these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together
    and add mellow, fruity flavor.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps-How to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>
<h2>
  It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe. You'll
  find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can
  expect:
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Mix-Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one
    bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in
    another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients,
    then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly
    lumpy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook-Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle
    over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook
    for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your
    favorite pancake toppings.
